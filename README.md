# JoinZoomScripts

Install This:

Use the scripts in this repo as a template.


You need to edit:
- each day (e.g. mon.ahk) should have the FILENAME for each class you join that day
- each class file needs the proper LINK and TIME (time is in 24 hour format, e.g. if its 1:15 PM, TimeToMeet = 1315)


Caveats:
- unless you set it up to launch mon.ahk or tues.ahk automatically on monday and tuesday, you have to do it whenever you startup your pc.
if your PC is on 24/7, you don't have to worry about this.

the bad part about having these scripts is that you're susceptible to forgetting to join class. Imagine your PC resets for whatever reason, its Monday, and you forget about class because you relied on these scripts to join for you. An easy solution is to simply always be at your computer and have google calendar notifications notify you. Or to try your best and be sure that the day script is running in the background.
